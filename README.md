## embedding code

Embedding code is _very_ easy. All you have to do 
is use a few backticks and list the name of the programming language! ðŸ˜¸

```cpp

int myFunc(int a, int b){
  int c = a + b; 
  return c;
  }  
```

## Style Examples

There's many different styles that you can use to format text:
**bold**

_italics_ or *italics*

*__bold and italics__*

~~strikethrough~~
