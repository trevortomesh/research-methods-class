## Necessary Things for a README

Depending on exactly what sort of project you are doing, there are a number of things that you may or may not want to include in a readme. There is really no **one true way** to do it. Readme's are a kind of _artform_.

*__However__* there are a few things that you should consider including:

1. Name of your project.
2. Description of your project.
3. Badges.
4. Graphics / Visuals
5. Install Instructions
6. Usage (how does one use the program once it is installed.)
7. Support / Contact Details.
8. Road-map (future ideas)
9. How to contribute
10. Authors / Acknowledgements (give credit where credit is due!)
11. License
12. Project Status

## Name of your Project

- This should be, simply, the name of your project.. maybe with some kind of a version Number

## Description of your project

- This is a brief, but accurate description telling potential users _exactly_ what your project is about. This is akin to an "abstract" in academic works. 

## Badges

- Badges are small images that convey meta data such as whether or not all the tests are passing, version numbers, languages used, etc. 

- Get badges at shields.io
