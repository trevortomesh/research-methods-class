## embedding code

Embedding code is _very_ easy. All you have to do 
is use a few backticks and list the name of the programming language! ðŸ˜¸

```cpp

int myFunc(int a, int b){
  int c = a + b; https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/licensing-a-repository
  return c;
  }  
```

## Style Examples

There's many different styles that you can use to format text:
**bold**

_italics_ or *italics*

*__bold and italics__*

~~strikethrough~~

## Necessary Things for a Readme

Depending on exactly what sort of project you are doing, there are a number of things that you may or may

not want to include in a readme. There is really no **one true way** to do it. Readme's are a kind of _artform_. 

*__However__* there are a few things that you should consider including:

1. Name of your project.
2. Description of your project.
3. Badges
4. Graphics / visuals
5. Installation Instructions
6. Usage (how does one use the program once it is installed)
7. Support / Contact Details.
8. Road-map (future ideas)
9. How to contribute
10. Authors / Acknowledgement (give credit where credit is due!)
11. License
12. Project Status

## Name of Your Project

- This should be, simply, the name of your project.. maybe with a version number.

## Description of your project

- This is a brief, but accurate description telling potential users exactly what your project
  is about. This is akin to an "abstract" in academic works.

## Badges

- Badges are small images that convey meta data such as whether or not all the test are 
  passing, version numbers, languages used.

## Visuals

- Visuals are very important. You might want to include screenshots of the code in operation. GIFS are also great. 
- Highly recommended!

## Installation

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's as easy as something like:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
  ```

- Often it involves downloading the source and building:

  ```
  git clone my-cool-repo.git
  cd /my-cool-repo
  cd /build
  make
  ```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible.

- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what's in the black boxes. __Keep that in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 

- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

  ```bash
  cool-project -arg1 -arg2
  ```
  - Then, maybe show a screenshot of the results! :smile:

## Support

Tell your users how they can get a hold of you. 

Contact: [email me](trevor.tomesh@gmail.com)

## Road-map

- List your planned future developments
- This is a good way to keep track of what it is that you want to do in the future!

## License

- Depending on what kind of project you are doing, you might have a copyright.
- Usually, on github, it's an open source project!
- You can find license info here: [license](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/licensing-a-repository)

## Project

- A lot of the time people will abandon projects. You should always let people know if you don't plan on working
  on a project anymore. 

  - Someone might choose to get a hold of you and take the reigns on your project. :happy:
