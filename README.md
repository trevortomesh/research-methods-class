## Manifest

- A manifest is a list of the top-level files in a project with a description of what each file is.

```
- newfile.txt --> A new file that says stuff in it
- README.md ----> This markdown file you are reading.
- img ----------> Images folder for the readme
```

## Necessary Things for a README

Depending on exactly what sort of project you are doing, there are a number of things that you may or may not want to include in a readme. There is really no **one true way** to do it. Readme's are a kind of _artform_.

*__However__* there are a few things that you should consider including:

1. Name of your project.
2. Description of your project.
3. Badges.
4. Graphics / Visuals
5. Install Instructions
6. Usage (how does one use the program once it is installed.)
7. Support / Contact Details.
8. Road-map (future ideas)
9. How to contribute
10. Authors / Acknowledgements (give credit where credit is due!)
11. License
12. Project Status

## Name of your Project

- This should be, simply, the name of your project.. maybe with some kind of a version Number

## Description of your project

- This is a brief, but accurate description telling potential users _exactly_ what your project is about. This is akin to an "abstract" in academic works. 

## Badges

![social](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/trevortomesh?style=social)![twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/trevortomesh?style=social)![languages](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/trevortomesh/research-methods-class)

- Badges are small images that convey meta data such as whether or not all the tests are passing, version numbers, languages used, etc. 
- Get badges at shields.io

## Visuals

- Visuals are very important! You might want to include screenshots of your code in operation. GIFS are also great!
- Just use the "![ ]()" to input images.

## Installation 

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's easy as something like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
```

- often it involves a bit of  downloading sources and building:

```bash
git clone my-cool-repo.git
cd /my-cool-repo
cd /build
make
```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible!!
- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what is in the black boxes. __Keep this in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 
- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

```bash
cool-project -arg1 -arg2
```

- then maybe show a screenshot of  the results :smile:

## Support

- tell users how they can get a hold of you

Contact: [email me](trevor.tomesh@gmail.com)

## Road-map

- List your panned future developments
- This is a good way to keep track of what it is that you want to do in the future!


## License

- Depending on what kind of project you are doing, you might have a specific copyright. 
- Usually on github, everything is open source!
- You can find license info here: [license](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/licensing-a-repository)

## Project Status

- A lot of the time people will abandon projects. You should always at least let people know if you aren't interested in working on a project anymore!
- Someone might want to pick it up on your behalf!
